# Dependency injection in ASP.NET Core


ASP.NET Core supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/introduction-to-inversion-of-control/) between classes and their dependencies.


A *dependency* is an object that another object depends on.
